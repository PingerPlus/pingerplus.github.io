# Commands & Permissions
Here's a quick guide on the commands and permissions you need to use to get started with Hynick:

### `/pm` (_plugin.manager.admin_)

### `/plugin enable <pluginName>` (_plugin.manager.enable_)
This command opens the book GUI that allows players to set their custom nickname. The GUI is easy to navigate and allows players to choose from a wide range of options to personalize their nickname.

### `/plugin disable <pluginName>` (_plugin.manager.disable_)
This command resets the player's current nickname to their default Minecraft username. This can be useful if a player wants to revert to their original username or change their nickname to something else.

### `/plugin reload <pluginName>` (_plugin.manager.reload_)
This command toggles the nick for the player. If this command is executed while the player is already nicked, the nick will be removed, otherwise a new nick, skin and rank will
be generated and applied to the said player.

### `/plugin description <pluginName>` (_plugin.manager.description_)
This command reloads the configuration files for Hynick, which can be useful if you've made changes to the plugin settings and want to apply them without restarting the server.

### `/plugin info <pluginName>` (_plugin.manager.admin_)
This command reloads the configuration files for Hynick, which can be useful if you've made changes to the plugin settings and want to apply them without restarting the server.

### `/plugin commands <pluginName>` (_plugin.manager.commands_)
This command reloads the configuration files for Hynick, which can be useful if you've made changes to the plugin settings and want to apply them without restarting the server.

### `/plugin whitelist add <pluginName>` (_plugin.manager.whitelist_)
